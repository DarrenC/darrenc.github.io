  - Now - software & processors are everywhere
  - Issues have consequences - VW fake mode for emissions tests

### TDD - 3 laws

- Cannot write production code until there is a unit test written that fails because it misses production code.
- Cannot continue unit test beyond where code is failing (NB - compile fail is a fail too)
- Cannot write any more production code than is required to pass the test

### Book tips

- Working effectively with legacy code, Michael Feathers
