# Getting Started

This page is now really old....

Scala Homepage - <http://www.scala-lang.org/>

## Tools

- Scala itself
- SBT - for building
- Eclipse - Scala IDE

On Mac you can get Scala and SBT using MacPorts

## Play Framework

- <http://www.playframework.com> - lightweight web framework for
Java/Scala
  - v1 was Java based
  - v2 is more Scala based

### Notes from Todo List tutorial

- I uncommented the properties config for the h2 in mem db but not
    sure if I needed to
- I had to recomment this section when deploying to heroku since the
    default db was being confused (heroku uses postregresql not h2)
- Some of the instructions for the build were inaccurate in the local
    version of the docs - they mentioned Build.scala but the convention
    is now to use build.sbt

Overall pretty great tutorial and good motivation to get back into
learning Scala.
