## Training

### Maple Syrup gel recipe

- Maple Syrup Gel Recipe:
  - I use roughly 60% maple syrup, 20-25% honey, 5-10% molasses, and
        some salt.
  - The theory is the maple syrup is the easiest and purest natural
        sugar to digest which is pretty much all glucose; the honey is
        generally about 50% fructose and 50% glucose -
  - from what I understand we can only process about 60 grams of
        glucose per hour but can process an extra 30g of fructose for a
        total of 90g of carbs (at full exertion our bodies burn more
        than we can take in so this extra bump from fructose can really
        matter) ;
  - the molasses adds more potassium and electrolytes and I like
        what it adds to the flavor (this is definitely the most personal
        and optional ingredient); and I add salt - the amount should
        really be based upon how much of a salt sweater you are\... I
        never really get the salt stains and also use sports drink
        (mostly OSMO) so only use about a 1/2 teaspoon. You can dilute
        with some water to make it easier to digest, particularly if you
        use a higher percentage of honey.
  - It really is a very economical way to fuel for longer and harder
        rides; the flask was something like \$5 and for \$30 of
        ingredients from Costco or similar (don't skimp on the quality
        or you may not be getting real maple syrup and honey) I probably
        get 100 gels worth.
