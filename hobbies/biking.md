## Training

### Maple Syrup gel recipe

- Maple Syrup Gel Recipe:
  - I use roughly 60% maple syrup, 20-25% honey, 5-10% molasses, and
        some salt.
  - The theory is the maple syrup is the easiest and purest natural
        sugar to digest which is pretty much all glucose; the honey is
        generally about 50% fructose and 50% glucose -
  - from what I understand we can only process about 60 grams of
        glucose per hour but can process an extra 30g of fructose for a
        total of 90g of carbs (at full exertion our bodies burn more
        than we can take in so this extra bump from fructose can really
        matter) ;
  - the molasses adds more potassium and electrolytes and I like
        what it adds to the flavor (this is definitely the most personal
        and optional ingredient); and I add salt - the amount should
        really be based upon how much of a salt sweater you are\... I
        never really get the salt stains and also use sports drink
        (mostly OSMO) so only use about a 1/2 teaspoon. You can dilute
        with some water to make it easier to digest, particularly if you
        use a higher percentage of honey.
  - It really is a very economical way to fuel for longer and harder
        rides; the flask was something like \$5 and for \$30 of
        ingredients from Costco or similar (don't skimp on the quality
        or you may not be getting real maple syrup and honey) I probably
        get 100 gels worth.

### Updating OpenStreetMap

- https://www.boards.ie/discussion/2058349397/a-request-to-action-camera-users

```

I was hoping to appeal to those of you with action cameras (garmin virb, gopro, insta360, an so on) to consider helping improve OpenStreetMap by uploading your recorded cycles.

I am not sure if you have considered it much but OpenStreetMap is used a lot in various tools used for us from our bike computers to route planning (strava, komoot and much more). OpenStreetMap us updated by anyone who wants to which can mean depending on the area if can be really well mapped or in other cases very lacking.

If your cycles are being recorded they can be uploaded to one of a few website which can take the recordings and overlay them on OpenStreetMap and this can then be used by anyone in Ireland or wider a field to update OpenStreetMap without the need to physically visit a location.

Updates can be beneficial to us for example we can record

    surface type and quality of roads or trails, which is great for route planning on komoot or strava
    bike paths and if they are segregated
    locations of cafes
    public water sources
    repair stands
    bicycle parking (capacity, stand time, covered or not)
    CCTV in relation to bike parking

If you'd be interested in sharing recorded rides or just see how it works the three main places at the moment that they can be uploaded to are

    Mapillary https://www.mapillary.com/
    Kartaview https://kartaview.org/
    Panoramax https://panoramax.fr/
