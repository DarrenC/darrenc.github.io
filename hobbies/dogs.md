## Poem: WE HAVE A SECRET

> We have a secret, you and I\
> that no one else shall know,\
> for who but I can see you lie\
> each night in fire glow?\
> And who but I can reach my hand\
> before we go to bed\
> and feel the living warmth of you\
> and touch your silken head?\
> And only I walk woodland paths\
> and see ahead of me,\
> your small form racing with the wind\
> so young again, and free.\
> And only I can see you swim\
> in every brook I pass\
> and when I call, no one but I\
> can see the bending grass.
