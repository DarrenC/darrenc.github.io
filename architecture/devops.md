## Devops Roadmap

- <https://roadmap.sh/devops>
- Also a useful list: <https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/j5k2nw/switching_to_a_career_in_devops_which_tools_will/>
  - 
    Config management; Ansible, Puppet, Chef, Saltstac, Packer (kinda also provisioning)
    Provisioning: Terraform, Salt, Ansible, Cloudformation (terraform the best in class in my opinion)
    CI/CD: Jenkins, Bamboo, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Travis CI, Jfrog Pipelines, TeamCity
    Version Control: Git, SVN
    Container Orchestration: K8s, Nomad, Rancher, Swarm, ECS (k8s commonly considered best in class)
    Monitoring & Alerting: Nagios, Zabbix, Prometheus, New Relic, Datadog
    Cloud Infrastructure: AWS, GCP, Azure
    Load Balancing: ALBs, HAProxy, Nginx
    Scripting/coding: Python, Bash, Groovy, Go

I am sure I missed a lot. But even more importantly in devops are some general practices and mindsets:

    Collaboration with Developers
    Identifying Bottlenecks
    Infrastructure as Code
    Test driven CI/CD
    Agile/Scrum

I would suggest checking out some books such as the Phoenix Project, DevOps Handbook, The Goal, Site Reliability Engineering (O'Reilly), Infrastructure as Code (O'Reilly),
