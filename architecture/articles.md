### Conway's Law

Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a
design whose structure is a copy of the organization\'s communication
structure. Fred Brooks cited the paper and the idea in his elegant
classic \"The Mythical Man-Month,\" calling it \"Conway\'s Law.\" The
name stuck.

## Clean Code notes

### Video 2 in the series

Very important and worth rewatching (and reading the chapter) Method and
variable naming

- Variable name - proportional to their scope - long lived, long
    name + vice versa
- Method names + Class names - inverse proportional to their scope -
    e.g. want public stuff to have short simple names

## Explaining Agile: Martin Fowler and Neil Ford talk 2013

YouTube Video:
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE6lbPLEAzc&list=WL&index=23>

9:02 - paraphrase - Scrum often suffers from not implementing technical
practices They take the project management stuff without taking the
technical stuff

<http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/designDead.html>

Predictive vs Agile Process First vs People First

Neil Ford -> Communication > Technology "Communication trumps technology every time"
-- Example - Malawi - "Rapid SMS" - Python +
Django - Helps detect disease outbreaks quickly in a country with little
infrastructure or digitisation of information.

Fowler Defined Process vs Imperical Process - Feed back loops Example:
Making Fruitcake vs (e.g. taking a shower in a strange hotel)

Tool - CC Board -> overview of lots of builds - TODO - what is
this??????

Pair Programming - Navigator/Implementer

## Legacy Code: 7 tips for approaching code you didn't write \| Vokal

Legacy Code: 7 tips for approaching code you didn't write Posted on June
19, 2015, written by Vince Mammana-Lupo

I was recently presented the opportunity to jump on a project that has
been running for 6 years and is easily a thousand files strong. Much of
my past engineering experience has been centered on smaller projects
that I either created or had direct access to the person who did. Thus,
I was a fish out of water inheriting a project of this magnitude. I am
writing this post to pass down some words of advice so that your
transition will be both productive and as painless as possible.

### Embrace the Past

What's done is done. Getting frustrated over a specific implementation
won't do you any good. There are tons of factors out of anyone's control
that could've contributed to the current state of the project you have
inherited. For example, maybe the developers were dealt a tight
deadline, or they didn't have all the information they needed in time to
make the architecture what it needed to be. We have all been there. It's
best to adopt a constructive mindset and use inheriting legacy code as
an opportunity to show what a great developer you are! If you can see
issues in code other people have written, pat yourself on the back and
remember: Don't Kick The Can.

### Don't Kick The Can

When there are hundreds or thousands of files in a project, chances are
you may never need to explore all of them. That said, if you are working
in a file where you realize there are major "issues," don't kick the
can. Make other team members aware of your concerns with the file in
question. Again, at least let somebody know. If possible, make the
improvements you can while you are working in that file. A solid
practice would be to leave a well documented comment in areas of concern
and creating corresponding tasks in the backlog to set aside designated
time for improvement. You will make someone else's life easier when
working in that file down the road.

### Refactor, Test, Refactor

Making things better generally isn't easy, especially when you are
working in a massive project where one file change comes with an
avalanche of ramifications. That said, refactoring and writing tests is
a great and proactive way of familiarizing yourself with the project
that you inherited. The thought behind this is that to refactor and test
a feature or specific implementation you will have to truly understand
the behavior of the code and the issue the code is addressing. This
process usually gets the developer diving into files he/she had no clue
existed and will quickly improve your knowledge of \"where things are
happening.\"

### New Feature? Pick Me! Pick Me

Let's be honest: inheriting legacy code is never easy. Even if you go at
it with the best mindset, piecing together an understanding of someone
else's thought process can be both very challenging and mentally
draining. That's why it could work to your benefit to volunteer for
building out new functionality. Nothing is better than the opportunity
to start fresh. You will definitely feel rejuvenated contributing some
well-written and well-documented code to a legacy project!

### It's Ok to Bug Me

Developers usually loathe bug fixes. They carry a constant undertone of
"busy work." However, taking on bug fixes can be another great way to
gain exposure to a new code base. I was afforded the luxury to take on
what were deemed "small" and "manageable" bugs at first. Small victories
from squashing bugs furthered my understanding of many of the various
features' architectures and provided me a channel to contribute to the
rest of the team very quickly.

### Documentation---Leave a Paper Trail

If you've inherited a legacy project, chances are you've experienced
frustration over not understanding what the previous developer was
trying to do. I pray you never see a 300-line method with high
cyclomatic complexity and without any comments. Save yourself and others
time down the road by writing well-documented comments for classes and
methods. Let people know what method "X" should be used for so they
don't have to waste time finding breadcrumbs and guessing at
functionality.

### Communication is Key

I have noticed that a huge contributor to success on a large legacy
project is communication. Never be afraid to lean on your teammates. If
you are working in a file or on a feature that a teammate built, do not
hesitate to poll them with questions and try to understand their logic.
It will definitely make things easier.

## Notes from Sandro Mancuso Refactoring and Testing Legacy code

- link to video on YouTube: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NnElPO5BU0>

### Tips

      Refactor from deepest to shallowest branch
      Test from shallowest to deepest branch

### Writing Tests

      Should + sentence is a good way to write test names that validate behaviour and not a technical implementation - e.g. shouldValidateLoggedInUser and not getTripsByUser
      A Seam: a seam is where 2 classes meet. Often when you are writing test classes for legacy code, the seam between the class under test and its dependent class(es) is in the method being tested. 
          This is a problem and should be avoided by moving the seam to another method which can then be overridden from the test class and mocked. 
          E.g. a db connection call in the method under test. You can move the call out to the DB connection to another protected method and then in the Test class you create a private class extending the class under test and override the protected method. The DB connection call is now mockable/stubbable etc. Cool!

Stopped watching at 32 mins but need to take notes, especially for the
BUILDER type pattern he used for creating Users, it's really nice.
