  - NB - this guy has a good book to read [The Age of Agile](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/0814439098/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0814439098&linkCode=as2&tag=stevdenndotco-20&linkId=cd66dad04abaa1915e98f25331be4e98)
  - Key points -
    - Law of the Customer - an obsession with delivering value to customers as the be-all and end-all of the organization.
    - Law of the Small Team - a presumption that all work be carried out by small self -organizing teams, working in short cycles and focused on delivering value to customers
    - Law of the Network - reduce the bureaucracy and top-down hierarchy

### Training Notes

Fabrice Galant - Trainer -> Works for Data4 - Was involved in the 1A Agile Transformation for AeTM

### Training Aims

- Learn Agile Principles and Mindset

Scrum -> Framework

**Exam:** Scrum.org VS Scrum Alliance 85% to pass 65% to pass 60 minutes - everlasting

### Examples of Team Tools

- Working Agreements
- Question board
- Niko Niko

**Note** - in Amadeus we never MoSCoW requirements like we did in AIB

- Scrum Master -> Is a CHANGE AGENT - bringing change to the team

- Mixing Scrum & Kanban - typically done before/after - e.g. Kanban of ideas feeding into Scrum of development

### Agile

- Fix time
- Estimate costs
- Negotiate Scope

                     SCOPE
                    /     \
                  TIME -- COSTS

**Transparency** - Implies both what the team is doing AND what is expected of them i.e. a Roadmap

### SHU HA RI Principle

**Scrum** - what it is /is not  -> see in notes

- Sprint  -> 1 MONTH MAX - limits the risk
- treat it like a small project

### Scrum Master Role

      Should be FULL TIME role, not mix of dev/SM
      Tricky to bring this role to organisations
          How to measure the impact?
          Always a Dev but shouldn't develop
      Observer
      Coach

### Stakeholders

Mkting Sponsor Architect Mgr PMO

      PO                                                DEV                                                  Scrum Master

Customer Other Scrum Teams

### Ceremonies

Should always focus on  ->

      Product
      Development

NOT PROCESS i.e. eventually the Scrum Master is no longer necessary

### Product Owner -

      Doesn't need to attend daily standup 
      Should be available for communication

### Project Mgmt

 -> done by Dev Team and PO - i.e. not an SM responsibility

10% - 0.5 Days per week on Backlog Refinement

### Backlog History

-> NOT PRESENT IN JIRA but very important

      Gives points for historical stories
      See the manual
      Take a selection from various sprints and update + replace stories as needed to have a good grouping

**Value Poker** - Product Owner - instead of sizing poker, they play
Value Poker

### Backlog

      Can use Value/Estimate ratio to identify quick wins for the sprints

#### Estimation and Planning

 -> Scrum - Scientific part isn't the poker sizing, it's in the
inspection and adaptation  -> Waterfall - Scientific part is in the
initial sizing estimates

Key Concept From Scrum.org

      Sprint Goal -> is the WHAT?                    - be committed on this
      Product Backlog Items -> is the HOW?      - be flexible on this

Sprint Planning - 8hrs/1month sprint

SM Tip  -> Don't always jump in to highlight issues immediately - Team
may fix the issues themselves or raise them at the retrospective

             -> If not raised, then raise @ retrospective

Story Point What it is:

      RISK
      COMPLEXITY
      SIZE

What it is not:

      TIME

Doing TIME stops us having the valuable opportunity to explore the RISK,
COMPLEXITY, SIZE

Transparency See the manual for the list of Data Items to make public

TIP  -> Transparency to outside world

Sprint Review

      Not a status meeting
      Stakeholders are there to provide feedback - make sure this is communicated and understood
      Demo is a part of Sprint Review but not it's only purpose
