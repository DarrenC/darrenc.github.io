- SSL vs TLS -
  - Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor protocol to SSL.
        TLS is an improved version of SSL. It works in much the same way
        as the SSL, using encryption to protect the transfer of data and
        information. The two terms are often used interchangeably in the
        industry although SSL is still widely used.
